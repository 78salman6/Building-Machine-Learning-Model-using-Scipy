# Building-Machine-Learning-Model-using-Scipy

    In this repository -
    1. I have used different machine learning models for Classification problem. Mainly, I have given Demo of Support vector machine and Gradient Boosting algorithms for Classification and I have used SVM to classify the image to better understand the algorithm. 
    2. I have used different machine learning models for Regression problem. Mainly, I have given Demo starting from Linear Regression to Lasso and Ridge Regression. Then I also discussed how SVM can be modified to solve Regression problem ( Support Vector Regression a special type of Regression problem ).
    3. I have used different machine learning models for Clustering problem. I started from discussing on K-Mean clustering algorithm, then I have given a brief on Mean shift algorithm then I have given a Demo on Mean Shift Algorithm. Then I discussed on Principle Component Analysis and Dimensionality Reduction and I have given a Demo on the same topic.
    
 For better Understanding please read my Notes in parallel to implementing algorithms.
All Datasets are available on data folder and I have used relative path of dataset considering my current directory structure.
