# Building-Machine-Learning-Model-using-Scipy

    In this repository -
    1. I have used different machine learning models for Classification problem. Mainly, I have given a Demo of Support vector machine and Gradient Boosting algorithms for Classification and I have used SVM to classify the image to better understand the algorithm. 
    2. I have used different machine learning models for Regression problem. Mainly, I have given a Demo on
